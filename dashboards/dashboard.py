# @module dashboard
# @description A Streamlit-based dashboard for visualizing bike sharing demand data
# @addresses Business questions:
#  1. What factors contribute to the number of bike rentals, and how do they impact rental rates?
#  2. Based on demand patterns, when is the optimal time to increase the number of bikes?

        **Insight**: In absolute terms, both user types follow similar seasonal patterns, with peaks in fall and summer and 
        troughs in winter. However, the amplitude of change is much more dramatic for casual users, whose numbers can quadruple from 
        winter to summer. Registered users show more stability across seasons, particularly from spring through fall. 
        This emphasizes the need for dynamic bike allocation that accounts for both the changing total demand and 
        the shifting user type composition across seasons.

    **User Type Insights:**
    
    - **Registered Users:** Form the majority across all seasons, but the proportion varies
    - **Casual Users:** Represent a higher proportion in summer and fall
    - **Seasonal Impact:** Winter shows the highest proportion of registered users, likely because casual users are more affected by adverse weather
    
    These patterns suggest:
    1. Target casual users for conversion to registered users in summer/fall
    2. Focus on registered user retention during winter
    3. Adjust bike availability for different user types based on season
